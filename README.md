# Dogen

Welcome to the Dogen! It develops the ideas inherent in [Cleon](https://github.com/nvoynov/cleon) and allows you to generate more advanced code skeletons based on a domain model.

## Overview

Basically, Cleon brings structure of services, entities, and gets the ability to create skeletons of these abstractions. But what happens when we shape it into a model, and what such model can bring us?

For a while I was brooding over some source code generators and finished with something similar to following and then develop the idea further in [demo_domain.dogen](https://github.com/nvoynov/dogen/blob/master/lib/erb/demo_domain.dogen) that serves as an example of [User Domain](https://github.com/nvoynov/cleon-users).

```ruby
Model.build do
  type :string
  type :integer
  type :email

  entity :user do
    attribute :name, :type => :string
    attribute :email, :type => :email
  end

  service :register do
    param :name, :type => :string
    param :email, :type => :email
    param :secred, :type => :string
    result :user
  end
end
```

Having Dogen, one can build a domain model using provided DSL, and then create the model skeleton code. The result will be just a bit more advanced than generated by Cleon. Basically, it will utilize types. But I going to skip all possible boring explanations here, and just propose you see the generated code. To get just install the gem and run the following two commands

    $ dogen $ample
    $ dogen model/demo_domain.dogen

This will create the sample and generate the sample skeleton.

### Some statistic

Just for fun, having developed [User Domain](https://github.com/nvoynov/cleon-users), I've got some statistics about code handwritten and generated by Dogen.

Line Type | Dogen | Users

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dogen'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dogen

## Usage

### Get help

    $ dogen

### Get sample domain

    $ dogen $ample

### Generate skeleton

    $ dogen MODEL

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
